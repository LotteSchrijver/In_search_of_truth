# in_search_of_truth
Repository for paper "In search of truth". Contains data and Python file to train BERT model. 


Data contains Tweet ids and labels (e.g., misinformation, incivility) given by coders. The Tweet IDs correspond to Dutch-language Tweets about covid that were posted between February 2020 and February 2022. This dataset was used to train a Roberta_2022 model to classify misinformation in Dutch-language Tweets. The repository also contains the Python file used to train and test the model. 

This data was used for the following project: 'In search of truth: A refined approach to data collection and annotation for BERT-based misinformation detection'. For this project, we developed a codebook to classify misinformation and other content-related characteristics, such as incivility, in Tweets, and elaborately trained four student assistants to classify 3400 Tweets using this codebook. 
The paper and codebook can be found here:
